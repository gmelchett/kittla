== The Kittla programming language

A programming language with fearfull concurrency, blazing frequency, black traits, eel genetics, laser blasters, eh what??
Naa, Kittla is just another partial, probably buggy, hobby implementation something that looks like TCL.

I've known that there is programming language called TCL for 20 years or so, but everyone that had an
opinion was kinda dismissive of TCL. I recently read http://antirez.com/articoli/tclmisunderstood.html which surfaces
on hacker news from time to time and to my surprised realized that the basic idea is beautiful
in its simplicity, yet effective, and still the code becomes readable. Not like some kind of rebus.
Since I've had an itch to write a lexer/parser/interpreter/vm for quite some time, I
couldn't resist the urge..

=== Any use?
I plan to incorporate Kittla into my console mpd client written in go that I've been from time to time hacking on for two-three
years by now. Not yet read for the public. I must bring it out of it's "eternal" beta stage
and smoke out some annoying bugs - not just add new features - like adding Kittla :-)

=== Why should I use it?

You shouldn't. Go away ;-) There are plenty of embedded languages for go that are far
more suitable for your hobby project.
The only cool thing about kittla is that is very small and easily extendable.


=== Why the weird name "kittla"?

Since TCL is pronounced "tickle" and "kittla" means "to tickle someone" in in Swedish
I though it would be suitable.
